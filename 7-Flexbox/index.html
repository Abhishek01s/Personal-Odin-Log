        <h1>Flexbox</h1>
        <p>Flexbox is not just a single CSS property but a whole toolbox of properties that you can use to put things where you need them. Some of these properties belong on the flex container, while some go on the flex items.</p>
        <p>A flex item is any element that lives directly inside of a flex container.</p>
        <h2>Flex-grow</h2>
        <p>flex-grow expects a single number as its value, and that number is used as the flex-item’s “growth factor”.</p>
        <h2>Flex-shrink</h2>
        <p>flex-shrink is similar to flex-grow, but sets the “shrink factor” of a flex item.</p>
        <p>flex-shrink only ends up being applied if the size of all flex items is larger than their parent container.</p>
        <h2>Flex-basis</h2>
        <p>flex-basis sets the initial size of a flex item, so any sort of flex-growing or flex-shrinking starts from that baseline size.</p>
        <p>Using auto as a flex-basis tells the item to check for a width declaration.</p>
        <h2>The flex shorthand</h2>
        <p>flex is a shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis.</p>
        <h2>Axes</h2>
        <p>flexbox can work either horizontally or vertically, and some rules change a bit depending on which direction you are working with.</p>
        <h2>Alignment</h2>
        <p>justify-content aligns items across the main axis.</p>
        <p>align-items aligns items across the cross axis.</p>
        <h2>Gap</h2>
        <p>Setting gap on a flex container adds a specified space between flex items, similar to adding a margin to the items themselves.</p>
